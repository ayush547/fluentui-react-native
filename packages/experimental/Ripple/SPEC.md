# Ripple

A `Ripple` is a component that can be used to add Fluent Ripple to existing Pressable components.

// Pressable Ripple does not support curved edges currently
// To get it working it needs to wrapped in a view where border is set
// This component was being considered to allow for this change to be done easily
// Props need to be split between the enclosing and inner views
// Code is hugely borrowed from Shadow component.
